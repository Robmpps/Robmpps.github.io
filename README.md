My GitHub account was made a few weeks ago just to download a specific software to access NTFS formatted drives on my Mac. Which was unsuccessful. However, I did find my subscription to the software to access NTFS. Then to find out I needed to download this today, its a win win.

My Repository is new, of course, because of this assignment. I am pretty excited to have a reason to actually use something like this.

Cloning the repository took me longer to do than I originally thought. I did not see the + in the top left of the desktop app. I ended up just doing a search within the app and I found the way to clone it. Commiting the changes took a while as well. The instructions state to edit the file as stated below, however, the instructions should have been to edit with that info right then and there instead of being directed to leave it for later.
